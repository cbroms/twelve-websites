        <summary>I'm building one website per month for a year.</summary>
        <p>I like to make websites. I've made a lot of them in the past.</p>
        <p>
          It takes a long time for me to make a website as a side project.
          Depending on the reason for making it, I often spend most of that time
          thinking, implementing something, changing my mind, and repeating the
          process. Sometimes I start with an interface in mind, but often the
          reason for creating the site evolves as it takes shape, so I shift
          what the interface is and refocus. Despite how long this takes, I like
          it because it means I get to spend a lot of time engaged in the
          experience of making. The
          <em>process</em> is, after all, the whole point. The end product is
          often not that impressive or interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to force a different way of approaching this. I want to see
          what happens when I am bounded by a timeframe; just one month to turn
          something that <em>could be</em> a website <em>into</em> a website. I
          have a very constrained amount of time to dedicate to this project,
          probably somewhere around 2-6 hours a week. That will require that
          what I make is simple in concept, design, and implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course this means what I make each month will be the product of
          less than 25 hours worth of effort. I don't want to make a shitty
          versions of what <em>could be</em> bigger websites, I want to make
          websites <em>can be</em> complete in less than 25 hours worth of
          effort. That means SIMPLE.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest I have no idea what simple really means in this context.
          The point of this project is to figure that out.
          <em>What is simplicity in design, implementation, and process?</em>
