          <p><em>A system for storing and retrieving links.</em></p>
          <p>
            I need to figure out some sort of system for storing and retrieving
            links I come across. Right now I'll keep the links open in tabs and
            eventually close them out. If I ever need to re-find something, I'll
            open up the browser history and search, which more often than not
            fails. Probably because the only thing that gets indexed in browser
            history is the urls, while I'll be trying to search by concept or
            something like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems like this link organizational system is something that a
            ton of people have tried to make, or have written about. The reason
            many fail, in my view at least, is that how you organize links is
            unique to your own brain. The sorts of categories you use can't be
            predetermined; they must be decided by you and maintained by you to
            ensure the connections between concept and links are strong. As a
            result, this software most likely works best when you make it
            yourself and it fits your own mental model of how things should be
            stored and retrieved. There's definitely principles that could be
            used to generalize this beyond a personal system, but as a start I
            think it makes the most sense to build something myself.

          <p>
            There’s something intriguing about new protocols. Especially in case
            of Gemini, a protocol that’s a kind of subset of an existing
            protocol—a stripped back version of HTTP with a higher level of
            security required from the outset. Pages can only contain text or
            links, no styling whatsoever and definitely no client-side
            scripting. I certainly like

          <p>
            This arose as part of August’s project: Wikipedia link previews. I
            love these things and wish they were everywhere. The problem is that
            dynamic global link previews aren’t really possible since they
            require making cross-origin requests from one site to another, which
            are generally restricted. The primary goal of this project is
            overcoming that limitation through serverless functions,
            specifically Cloudflare Workers. I’ve wanted to try this technology
            out for a while, and this feels like a nice and simple little
            project to give it a shot. I’m used to writing traditional APIs and
            deploying them myself, so writing little snippets of code that run
            on abstracted machines feels very Twelve-websites-esqe in it’s
            simplicity, if I can get it to work.

          <p><em>A link-based writing system.</em></p>
          <p>
            This one’s something I’ve wanted to build for a while;
            <em>a truly linked writing system</em>. Meaning every piece of
            writing has both forward and back-links. Each page is part of a
            larger network of pages. This is not a particularly new idea, but
            it’s something that I’ve always been curious to try designing and
            building myself; it seems like a really elegant system. Given it’s
            been implemented plenty of times over, I do want to change it up a
            bit and explore a bit of new territory when it comes to how the site
            is constructed. I’d like to make it local-first, meaning the primary
            representation of these pages—markdown—is stored on your machine and
            any editing happens locally, rather than online. The site itself is
            built from these pages and served in as minimal a way as possible as
            as a static site. So the ‘live’ version lives on your own machine,
            and the ‘preserved’ version is the static site that lives online.

          <p>
            Websites are nice, but they can get a bit stale. Stale in the sense
            that any given web design pattern becomes set and it's difficult to
            get past it and see new ways of accomplishing the task. Not that
            this is always a bad thing; familiar design patterns vastly simplify
            the amount of effort it takes to engage with new sites. But it can
            feel stale from both the perspective of using and building websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, the bulk of this month's effort won't be building a
            website. A website will be a final product, but the majority of what
            I'm interested in exploring is a process:

          <p>
            I've been thinking about building tools for interfacing with the web
            in new and perhaps unusual ways for quite a while. I have yet to
            really launch into building them, so as with last month I'm using
            Twelve Websites as an opportunity to begin that exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea for this website is a system for finding new links. I'd
            like to build new ways to explore the web, beyond just using a
            text-based search engine. This website should serve as a search
            engine for finding new websites, not found by searching content, but
            by links. Drop a link into the site, and it should return ten or so
            new directions; websites that are linked from the original or are
            perhaps one to two steps removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main idea I'd like to establish here is that crawling a website
            can lead to new and unexpected links out to other websites, and that
            collating them provides some kind of value.

          <p><em>A website for plain HTML + CSS conversations.</em></p>
          <p>
            Could the feeling of "cozy" (if at all) translate into a digital
            system? This idea has been explored quite a bit in the past, and
            there certainly some systems that can illicit this feeling.
            Conversational systems, however, aren't usually considered in this
            light. They're clear, understandable, on occasion expressive, but
            not often cozy places to hang out.
          </p>
          <p>
            How about a system where conversation can happen slowly over time,
            building a kind of garden of thoughts and artifacts to house them.
            The slowness of it pushes it in the direction of coziness; it has to
            be slow and <em>crafted</em>, while also being familiar enough that
            it sits in contrast to other more familiar methods of digital
            communication. The blog is not a place for "my ideas, formulated as
            posts" but rather a conversation between myself and others that
            evolves over time through a series of pages that are unique in their
            presentation and have a strong tie between content, structure, and
            style.

            I've
            <a target="_blank" href="https://futureland.tv/christian/emulations"
              >recently been exploring old operating systems through
              emulators</a
            >
            I've found online. There's a ton of richness to them, and I have yet
            to be able to find a way to really process them and all the effort
            that went into how their interfaces were designed and constructed.
            They're also a fantastic resource for interface design; there are
            plenty of details that made certain OS iterations really stand out
            as the canonical button, for example. There's not a very good way to
            explore these UI elements outside of finding screenshots online, but
            these screenshots don't show everything and aren't taken to really
            showcase just how a button, checkbox, or scrollbar function and
            look.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like to build a website that addresses this gap and serves as a
            neat place to go to find the standard input bars, tabs, windows,
            buttons, and so on included in old operating systems.

            I'm not sure how it happens, but there are certain phrases that
            catch on in a way that feels… unnatural. It's like there are certain
            phrases manufactured to perfectly frame a particular subject, but
            perhaps in a way that's too perfect, too well considered. You hear
            these phrases all the time, but when you hear someone you know say
            them you think "that's strange, you've never used that phrase before
            and yet I've heard it all the time." I certainly do at least. Seems
            like
